_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own name/details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get high marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
...  I spend 5 days in code.I read the lecture the lecture and review the particals to more understanding how class work and tesing. 
Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. See http://wakatime.com (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history)

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
I can modify my assignment 1 and my kivy design look like as demo

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
The least will be main.py, even though GUI program run.And then, I was not able to do the sorting exactly as the video demo

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
 In main.py and a1_classes.py  are work well in the class

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?i
I wanna learn how kivy work and i wanna make more practice

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
I reread the lecture slide and practical and then find the internet.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
When combining app.kyi and classes are the man challenge for me. I watch then youtube video and discuss my classmate.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
Classes support a powerful programming model by encapsulating related functionality into objects. The benefit of 
organized code is especially important for maintenance, where changes or enhancements can be limited to the objects that
 are affected by the change. Classes enhance code reuse.
